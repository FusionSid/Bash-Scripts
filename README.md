# Bash-Scripts

These are scripts I can use in terminal to automate tasks.

## Quick Commit (qcommit.sh)
Instead of doing this everytime:
```
git pull
git add .
git commit -m "Edit"
git push
```

I can just put the qcommit.sh file in my project file and then all I have to do is go:
```
bash qcommit.sh Edit
```

## Whats my ip? (ip.sh)
Instead of having to memorise my ip address or have to google it / ifconfig it everytime I can just use:
```
bash ip.sh
```
in terminal to quickly get my ip address
